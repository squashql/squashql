## Cache

SquashQL provides an in-memory query cache to not re-execute queries already executed. It has two main benefits:

- It reduces the need to frequently retrieve data from the database, thereby lowering the overall load on the
  database server and potentially reducing the resources required for database operations.
- It speeds up queries by holding frequently requested data.

By default, an implementation with the following characteristic is provided
- Cache is user based if a bean of type `Supplier<SquashQLUser>` is provided. Otherwise, it is shared with all users
- 32 results are stored per user
- Results older than 5 minutes are discarded

### Cache invalidation

The results older than 5 minutes are considered as invalid, but it is possible to invalidate the cache when executing a 
query, see  [QUERY.md#query-cache](QUERY.md#query-cache). 

If a different strategy needs to be implemented, the cache is accessible from the `QueryController` object:

```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {

  public MyComponent(QueryController queryController) {
    QueryCache queryCache = queryController.queryExecutor.queryCache;
    // TODO 
  }
}
```

The method `void clear()` or `void clear(SquashQLUser user)` are to be called to invalidate the cache.

### More details

The code can be found in the classes `GlobalCache` and `CaffeineQueryCache`. See usage in `QueryExecutor`.
