## Overview

AITM is an open-source SQL query engine specialized in what-if analysis, building multi-dimensional queries to help back- end developers make the most of any SQL database, and front-end developers easily configure their own metrics in the UI.

- AITM is a middleware between different databases and a front end.
- It builds queries that were not possible in SQL and is compatible with several popular SQL databases.
- It helps front-end developers run SQL queries in their own language in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
