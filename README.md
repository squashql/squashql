SquashQL is an open-source SQL query engine specialized in what-if analysis, building multi-dimensional queries to help
back-end developers make the most of any SQL database, and front-end developers easily configure their own metrics in
the UI.

- It is a middleware between [a SQL database](#compatibility) and multiple clients/front end. Heavy computation is delegated to the underlying database. 
- It makes calculations that were not possible or cumbersome in SQL easy to perform. See [comparison measures](./QUERY.md#complex-comparison)
- It helps front-end developers build and run SQL queries from their front-end or node.js applications thanks to its [TypeScript SQL-like query builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@squashql/squashql-js) 
- With its "write once, run everywhere" approach, it is a great solution for those who need to quickly and efficiently query data from multiple databases.

## Try SquashQL

You can try SquashQL directly from your web browser with [our showcase project](https://github.com/squashql/squashql-showcase/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md). No need to install anything!

## Compatibility

SquashQL is currently compatible with the following SQL databases: [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), 
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) 
and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). 

## API

SquashQL provides an easy-to-use Typescript library to write SQL-like queries. See the [full documentation here](./QUERY.md).

```typescript
import {
    from, avg
} from "@squashql/squashql-js"

const q = from("Orders")
    .select(["customer_id"], [], [avg("average_spends", "amount")])
    .build();
```

SquashQL comes with a [Spring Controller](./server/src/main/java/io/squashql/spring/web/rest/QueryController.java) to expose 
http endpoints.

1. `GET  /metadata`: it returns the list of tables and fields available
2. `POST /query`: to execute a query. It accepts a json object built with the Typescript library and returns a two-dimensional
array representing the result table of the computation. 
3. `POST /query-merge`: to execute *Drilling across* query i.e. querying two fact tables. The two results are aligned by 
performing a sort-merge operation on the common attribute column headers. More on [Drilling across](./documentation/DRILLING-ACROSS.md).

To use those endpoints, you can use the `Querier` object from squashql-js library.

```typescript
import {count, sum, from, Querier, QueryMerge} from "@squashql/squashql-js"

const serverUrl = "http://localhost:8080";
const querier = new Querier(serverUrl)

// Calling GET  /metadata
querier.getMetadata().then(response => console.log(response))

const myFirstQuery = from("myTable")
        .select(["col1"], [], [count])
        .build()

// POST /query with myFirstQuery as payload
querier.execute(myFirstQuery).then(response => console.log(response))

// POST /query-merge
const mySecondQuery = from("otherTable")
        .select(["col1", "col2"], [], [sum("alias", "field")])
        .build()
querier.executeQueryMerge(new QueryMerge(myFirstQuery, mySecondQuery)).then(response => console.log(response))
```

The object `Querier` uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) under the hood as HTTP
Client. [Additional configuration](https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config) can be
provided like this:

```typescript
const axiosConfig = {
  timeout: 10000
}
const serverUrl = "http://localhost:8080";
const querier = new Querier(serverUrl, axiosConfig)
```

### Under the hood

SquashQL helps you executing multi-dimensional queries compatible with several databases. The syntax is closed to SQL but... 

> What happens exactly when the query is sent to SquashQL?

Once the query is received by SquashQL server, it is analyzed and broken down into one or multiple *elementary* 
queries that can be executed by the underlying database. Before sending those queries for execution, SquashQL first looks
into its query cache (see [CaffeineQueryCache](https://github.com/squashql/squashql/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/squashql/query/CaffeineQueryCache.java))
to see if the result of each *elementary* query exist. If it does, the result is returned immediately. If it does not, 
the elementary query is translated into compatible SQL statement, sent and executed by the database. 
The intermediary results are cached into SquashQL query cache for future reuse and used to compute the final query result. 

### Configuration

To connect SquashQL to your database you will first have to import the associated maven module and defined in your 
java project a `QueryEngine` and `Datasatore` by picking the correct implementations. Then declare a bean that returns 
the `QueryEngine` instance.

Find a ready-to-use example with Apache Spark and Spring Boot [here](https://github.com/squashql/squashql-showcase).

## Prerequisites

### Java

You need to have Java 17:

- [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)

If you need to build the TypeScript library locally, you need to have Node installed.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Testing

To run the tests you will need:
